Data Dictionary - Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

"1" "sub_id"  - identifies subject 1-30.
"2" "activity" - categorical variable has 6 levels describes the activity of the subject.
                 LAYING SITTING STANDING WALKING WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS WALKING_UPSTAIRS 
The all the variables below are mean value of individial subjects activity.                 
prefix t - time domain signal captured at 50 Hz
prefix f - frequency domain signal.
X,Y,Z - denote 3 axial signal in X,Y,Z directions.
Acc - acceleration signal - divided into body and gravity signal.
Gyro - signal obtained from gyroscope.
tBodyAccJerk and tBodyGyroJerk - The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
Mag - magnitude of three dimensional signal.
mean & std - mean and standard deviation values are estimated from the signal.
